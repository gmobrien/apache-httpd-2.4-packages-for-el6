# BACKGROUND #

It is my intention to maintain these packages until a similar software stack is
stable on an EL7 platform, but I am only maintaining thise pacakges in my spare
time.  I don't have the time or resources to maintain software as part of my
day job!

I also want to document how to update and run a an up-to-date and optimized
LAMP stack on EL6.  Suggestions are welcome if you see a better way to do
things.  I'm going to be looking closely at the current Fedora packaging
process as I haven't had to maintain RPMs for several years and there have
been some advances in the state of the art.
