This project consists of the RPM spec files and local patches required to
maintain the Apache HTTPD 2.4 packages for EL6.

Links to complete SRPMS with all upstream dependencies as well as local
patches will be provided.  I just need to verify that there are no licensing
issues related to distribution first.
